                        Using html, css, js, node.js, I created a website that allows users to register,
                        post their pets for adoption or look for available pets.

                        This responsive website was my first serious project. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Otherwise, don't hesitate to hit me up for suggestions!

                    This was my first degree attempt. I believe that someday, I might be able to combine my passion for software
